# workflow
This repository is using dlilab- manuscript template. It is intended to use prostate cancer data set using R programming and to visualize the mutant genes and how these genes  are involved in different prostate cancer types. Using R programming, I am trying to make automated and organized analysis, as much as possible.

This repository has the following file folders:

- `Data`: this folder is used to hold raw data and output data.
- `R`: this folder holds all R codes.
- `Figs` holds figures generated from R codes.
- `Doc`: this folder holds manuscripts.
